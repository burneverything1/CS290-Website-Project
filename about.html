        This website allows users to input a stock ticker and get back the last day's prices and volumes. The user is also able to download
        more days worth of price data in a CSV upon pressing the "Download CSV" button. This data can be used to create your own user
        charts and analysis. If you need more in-depth data please visit the Alphavantage site where they offer different types of API's for
        different types of price data and other metrics that might be important to you.

        This website was built as a project for Oregon State University's CS290 Web Development class by Tim Yehan Lee. It uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
        Maybe as he learns more, the website will be expanded. The Data page makes an API request to Alphavantage and then accesses the JSON object response.
